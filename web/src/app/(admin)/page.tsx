                    <br/> This was a personal project of <u>deadlyunicorn</u> (a Web Dev - apparently),
                    <br/> made for fun and in order to explore what is possible with NextJS
                    <br/> (NextJS is a Fullstack Framework based on React) and other Tools.
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p> Feel free to explore the store, the different pages and the source code.
                    <br/> The used tools are listed in the /about section.
                    <br/> You can also see how things were put up together
                    <br/> by clicking &quot;How it works&quot; down at the footer.
